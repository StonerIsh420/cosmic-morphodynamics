# Cosmic Morphodynamics — Stoner–Turing RDA Toy Model

This repository contains a self-contained toy model exploring how **reaction–diffusion–advection (RDA)** dynamics can generate galaxy-like and web-like morphologies in a rotating baryonic medium. It is *not* a replacement for dark matter or ΛCDM, but a complex-systems analogy and a visual sandbox for pattern formation in an excitable medium.

The project consists of:

- **Paper I — Theoretical Framework**: `Cosmic Morphodynamics Hypothesis.md`  
  Derives the two-field Stoner–Turing equations, defines the physical mapping (gas activator & radiation inhibitor), and clearly states the limitations of the model (2-D, no self-gravity, phenomenological parameters).

- **Paper II — Computational Verification**: `Computational Verification of Cosmic Morphodynamics.md`  
  Describes the numerical experiment, parameter choices, and qualitative results obtained from the Python simulation.

- **Python implementation**: `CMH.py`  
  A ~221-line reference implementation of the Stoner–Turing RDA model with Keplerian-like advection and live visualization.

- **Figures & animations**: `results/`  
  Example PNG frames and GIFs generated by `CMH.py`.

## 1. Scientific Scope and Disclaimer

This model is deliberately minimal and phenomenological:

- 2-D thin-disk approximation (no vertical structure).
- No self-gravity or Poisson solver; the velocity field is imposed by hand.
- Parameters (`DIFF_G`, `DIFF_R`, `FEED`, `KILL`, `ETA`) are in simulation units, not calibrated to km/s, pc, or Myr.
- No attempt is made to fit rotation curves, lensing maps, or the cosmological matter power spectrum.

As stated in **Paper I**, this work should be interpreted as:

> A **toy model and morphological analogy** for baryonic structure formation in an excitable medium, not a physically complete alternative to ΛCDM or non-baryonic dark matter.

Use it as a **pattern-formation lab**, not as a cosmological replacement.

- `CMH.py` — main simulation script.
- `results/` — sample outputs from a reference run.
- The two `.md` files — standalone papers (Paper I and Paper II).

## 3. Installation

This project targets **Python 3.10+** and uses only standard scientific Python packages.

### Dependencies

Install via `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy pillow
```

---

## 4. Running the Simulation

From the repository root:

```bash
python CMH.py
```

By default, `CMH.py` will:

1. Initialize the gas (`G`) and radiation (`R`) fields with a central perturbation plus small noise.
2. Evolve the 2-D Stoner–Turing RDA system on a `200 × 200` periodic grid using:
   - 5-point Laplacian (diffusion),
   - explicit Euler time integration,
   - a radius-dependent rotational warp (semi-Lagrangian advection).
3. Display a two-panel figure:
   - Left: real-space gas field (interpreted as “baryonic density”).
   - Right: log-magnitude Fourier power spectrum of `G`.
4. Save an animation to:

```text
![Cosmic Morphodynamics]("https://github.com/StonerIsh420/cosmic-morphodynamics/blob/d7739fa255ab64a075acf7b6d63cf5c8a1fcebe5/results/cosmic_morphodynamics_spiral.gif")
```

(If the `results/` directory does not exist, create it or adjust the save path in `CMH.py`.)

You can change the number of frames, time step, or pattern regime by editing the constants near the top of `CMH.py`:

- `NUM_FRAMES`
- `STEPS_PER_FRAME`
- `DIFF_G`, `DIFF_R`
- `FEED`, `KILL`
- `ROTATION_STRENGTH`

Small changes can move the system between spot, stripe, labyrinth, and more spiral-like regimes.

## 5. Reproducing the Figures

The PNGs in `results/` were generated by running `CMH.py` with:

- `N = 200`
- `DIFF_G = 0.16`
- `DIFF_R = 0.08`
- `FEED = 0.040`
- `KILL = 0.060`
- `ETA = 1.0`
- `ROTATION_STRENGTH = 0.05`

To regenerate them:

1. Delete the existing PNGs / GIFs in `results/`.
2. Run `python CMH.py`.
3. Optionally modify the script to save intermediate frames at chosen timesteps.

## 6. Citing / Referencing

If you reference this repository in a talk, blog, or paper, a simple citation is:

> Stoner (2025), *Cosmic Morphodynamics: A Reaction–Diffusion–Advection Toy Model for Baryonic Structure Formation*, GitHub repository.

You can also cite the two internal papers directly:

- **Paper I:** *Cosmic Morphodynamics Hypothesis* — theoretical framework and limitations.
- **Paper II:** *Computational Verification of Cosmic Morphodynamics* — numerical experiment and qualitative results.

## 8. Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by:

- Classic reaction–diffusion work (Turing patterns, Gray–Scott model).
- Galactic morphology and large-scale-structure studies in the ΛCDM context.
- The broader idea that complex astrophysical structures can sometimes be fruitfully explored through simple excitable-media analogies.
